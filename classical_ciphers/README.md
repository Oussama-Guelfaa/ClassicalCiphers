# ClassicalCiphers

## Description

**ClassicalCiphers** is a Python project that implements several classical encryption algorithms, including Caesar, Vigenère, and Playfair ciphers. It provides functionalities for encryption, decryption, and frequency analysis. The project is designed with modularity and readability in mind, making it a valuable resource for learning and demonstrating classical cryptography concepts.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Supports encryption and decryption with a shift key between 1 and 25.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: Implements encryption and decryption using an alphabetic keyword.
- **Playfair Cipher**: Provides encryption and decryption using a keyword to generate the key matrix.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Analyzes text to display the frequency of each letter.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate modules and classes for each cipher.
- **Unit Tests**: Includes tests for each cipher to ensure correctness.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
